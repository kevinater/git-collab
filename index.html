    <div id="p1">
    <p>We are a nonprofit organization committed to stopping online hate crimes.  With the increase in social media, online communication has soared to unforeseen levels.  Unfortunately, this increase has brought about negative interactions between online users.  In fact, roughly 4 in 10 Americans have experienced a form of online harrassment.  This is a problem we aim to prevent through info sessions, charity, and interacting and educating in schools.  <b>Overall, our mission is to educate individuals in recognizing and preventing online hate crimes when they happen.</b></p>
